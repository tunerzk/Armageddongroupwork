Expected Deliverables
Deliverable A — Terraform
You must submit Terraform that creates/updates:
  1) Two cache policies
    static (aggressive caching)
    api (caching disabled OR origin-driven)

  2) Two origin request policies
    static minimal forwarding
    api forwards required headers/query/cookies (but doesn’t necessarily include them in cache key)

  3) Two cache behaviors
    path_pattern = "/static/*" → static policies
    path_pattern = "/api/*" → api policies

  4) Be A Man Challenge: Response headers policy for explicit Cache-Control on static responses (or security headers)

Deliverable B — Correctness Proof (CLI evidence)
  You must submit:
    A) curl -I outputs for:
        /static/example.txt (must show cache hit behavior)
        /api/list (must NOT cache unsafe content)
    B) A short written explanation:
      “What is my cache key for /api/* and why?”
      “What am I forwarding to origin and why?”

Deliverable C - Haiku
    You must submit  
      A) Haiku describing Chewbacca's perfections.

Deliverable D - Technical Verification (CLI) — “Correctness, not vibes”

1) Static caching proof
Run twice:
  curl -I https://chewbacca-growl.com/static/example.txt
  curl -I https://chewbacca-growl.com/static/example.txt

Look for:
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=... (from response headers policy)
  Age: increases on subsequent requests (cached object indicator) 

  If Age never appears/increases, caching isn’t working (or TTL is 0 / headers prevent caching).

2) API must NOT cache unsafe output
Run twice:
  curl -I https://chewbacca-growl.com/api/list
  curl -I https://chewbacca-growl.com/api/list

Expected for “safe default” API behavior:
    Age should be absent or 0
    Responses should reflect fresh origin behavior
    If you add auth later, you must never allow one user to see another’s response

3) Cache key sanity checks (query strings)
Static should ignore query strings by default:
  curl -I "https://chewbacca-growl.com/static/example.txt?v=1"
  curl -I "https://chewbacca-growl.com/static/example.txt?v=2"
Expected:
both map to the same cached object (hit ratio stays high) because static cache policy ignores query strings (unless students intentionally change it)

4) “Stale read after write” safety test
  If your API supports writes:
    POST a new row
    Immediately GET /api/list
    Ensure the new row appears
      If it doesn’t, they accidentally cached a dynamic response.
